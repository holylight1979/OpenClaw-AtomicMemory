## How to Contribute

1. **Bugs & small fixes** → Open a PR!
2. **New features / architecture** → Start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/discussions) or ask in Discord first
3. **Refactor-only PRs** → Don't open a PR. We are not accepting refactor-only changes unless a maintainer explicitly asks for them as part of a concrete fix.
4. **Test/CI-only PRs for known `main` failures** → Don't open a PR. The Maintainer team is already tracking those failures, and PRs that only tweak tests or CI to chase them will be closed unless they are required to validate a new fix.
5. **Questions** → Discord [#help](https://discord.com/channels/1456350064065904867/1459642797895319552) / [#users-helping-users](https://discord.com/channels/1456350064065904867/1459007081603403828)

## Before You PR

- Test locally with your OpenClaw instance
- Run tests: `pnpm build && pnpm check && pnpm test`
- For extension/plugin changes, run the fast local lane first:
  - `pnpm test:extension <extension-name>`
  - `pnpm test:extension --list` to see valid extension ids
  - If you changed shared plugin or channel surfaces, run `pnpm test:contracts`
  - For targeted shared-surface work, use `pnpm test:contracts:channels` or `pnpm test:contracts:plugins`
  - If you changed broader runtime behavior, still run the relevant wider lanes (`pnpm test:extensions`, `pnpm test:channels`, or `pnpm test`) before asking for review
- If you have access to Codex, run `codex review --base origin/main` locally before opening or updating your PR. Treat this as the current highest standard of AI review, even if GitHub Codex review also runs.
- Do not submit refactor-only PRs unless a maintainer explicitly requested that refactor for an active fix or deliverable.
- Do not submit test or CI-config fixes for failures already red on `main` CI. If a failure is already visible in the [main branch CI runs](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions), it's a known issue the Maintainer team is tracking, and a PR that only addresses those failures will be closed automatically. If you spot a _new_ regression not yet shown in main CI, report it as an issue first.
- Do not submit test-only PRs that just try to make known `main` CI failures pass. Test changes are acceptable when they are required to validate a new fix or cover new behavior in the same PR.
- Ensure CI checks pass
- Keep PRs focused (one thing per PR; do not mix unrelated concerns)
- Describe what & why
- Reply to or resolve bot review conversations you addressed before asking for review again
- **Include screenshots** — one showing the problem/before, one showing the fix/after (for UI or visual changes)
- Use American English spelling and grammar in code, comments, docs, and UI strings
- Do not edit files covered by `CODEOWNERS` security ownership unless a listed owner explicitly asked for the change or is already reviewing it with you. Treat those paths as restricted review surfaces, not opportunistic cleanup targets.

## Review Conversations Are Author-Owned

If a review bot leaves review conversations on your PR, you are expected to handle the follow-through:

- Resolve the conversation yourself once the code or explanation fully addresses the bot's concern
- Reply and leave it open only when you need maintainer or reviewer judgment
- Do not leave "fixed" bot review conversations for maintainers to clean up for you
- If Codex leaves comments, address every relevant one or resolve it with a short explanation when it is not applicable to your change
- If GitHub Codex review does not trigger for some reason, run `codex review --base origin/main` locally anyway and treat that output as required review work

This applies to both human-authored and AI-assisted PRs.

## Control UI Decorators

The Control UI uses Lit with **legacy** decorators (current Rollup parsing does not support
`accessor` fields required for standard decorators). When adding reactive fields, keep the
legacy style:

```ts
@state() foo = "bar";
@property({ type: Number }) count = 0;
```

The root `tsconfig.json` is configured for legacy decorators (`experimentalDecorators: true`)
with `useDefineForClassFields: false`. Avoid flipping these unless you are also updating the UI
build tooling to support standard decorators.

## AI/Vibe-Coded PRs Welcome! 🤖

Built with Codex, Claude, or other AI tools? **Awesome - just mark it!**

Please include in your PR:

- [ ] Mark as AI-assisted in the PR title or description
- [ ] Note the degree of testing (untested / lightly tested / fully tested)
- [ ] Include prompts or session logs if possible (super helpful!)
- [ ] Confirm you understand what the code does
- [ ] If you have access to Codex, run `codex review --base origin/main` locally and address the findings before asking for review
- [ ] Resolve or reply to bot review conversations after you address them

AI PRs are first-class citizens here. We just want transparency so reviewers know what to look for. If you are using an LLM coding agent, instruct it to resolve bot review conversations it has addressed instead of leaving them for maintainers.

## Current Focus & Roadmap 🗺

We are currently prioritizing:

- **Stability**: Fixing edge cases in channel connections (WhatsApp/Telegram).
- **UX**: Improving the onboarding wizard and error messages.
- **Skills**: For skill contributions, head to [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/) — the community hub for OpenClaw skills.
- **Performance**: Optimizing token usage and compaction logic.

Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues) for "good first issue" labels!

## Maintainers

We're selectively expanding the maintainer team.
If you're an experienced contributor who wants to help shape OpenClaw's direction — whether through code, docs, or community — we'd like to hear from you.

Being a maintainer is a responsibility, not an honorary title. We expect active, consistent involvement — triaging issues, reviewing PRs, and helping move the project forward.

Still interested? Email contributing@openclaw.ai with:

- Links to your PRs on OpenClaw (if you don't have any, start there first)
- Links to open source projects you maintain or actively contribute to
- Your GitHub, Discord, and X/Twitter handles
- A brief intro: background, experience, and areas of interest
- Languages you speak and where you're based
- How much time you can realistically commit

We welcome people across all skill sets — engineering, documentation, community management, and more.
We review every human-only-written application carefully and add maintainers slowly and deliberately.
Please allow a few weeks for a response.

## Report a Vulnerability

We take security reports seriously. Report vulnerabilities directly to the repository where the issue lives:

- **Core CLI and gateway** — [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
- **macOS desktop app** — [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (apps/macos)
- **iOS app** — [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (apps/ios)
- **Android app** — [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (apps/android)
- **ClawHub** — [openclaw/clawhub](https://github.com/openclaw/clawhub)
- **Trust and threat model** — [openclaw/trust](https://github.com/openclaw/trust)

For issues that don't fit a specific repo, or if you're unsure, email **security@openclaw.ai** and we'll route it.

### Required in Reports

1. **Title**
2. **Severity Assessment**
3. **Impact**
4. **Affected Component**
5. **Technical Reproduction**
6. **Demonstrated Impact**
7. **Environment**
8. **Remediation Advice**

Reports without reproduction steps, demonstrated impact, and remediation advice will be deprioritized. Given the volume of AI-generated scanner findings, we must ensure we're receiving vetted reports from researchers who understand the issues.

## Agent Development Reference

> Canonical development rules for AI coding agents working on this repo.
> Extracted from `AGENTS.md` to reduce runtime prompt token cost; CI/pre-commit may also reference these sections.
> When working on OpenClaw with an AI agent, point it at this section if it needs build/style/testing context.

### Project Structure & Module Organization

- Source code: `src/` (CLI wiring in `src/cli`, commands in `src/commands`, web provider in `src/provider-web.ts`, infra in `src/infra`, media pipeline in `src/media`).
- Tests: colocated `*.test.ts`.
- Docs: `docs/` (images, queue, Pi config). Built output lives in `dist/`.
- Nomenclature: use "plugin" / "plugins" in docs, UI, changelogs, and contributor guidance. `extensions/*` remains the internal directory/package path to avoid repo-wide churn from a rename.
- Plugins: live under `extensions/*` (workspace packages). Keep plugin-only deps in the extension `package.json`; do not add them to the root `package.json` unless core uses them.
- Plugins: install runs `npm install --omit=dev` in plugin dir; runtime deps must live in `dependencies`. Avoid `workspace:*` in `dependencies` (npm install breaks); put `openclaw` in `devDependencies` or `peerDependencies` instead (runtime resolves `openclaw/plugin-sdk` via jiti alias).
- Import boundaries: extension production code should treat `openclaw/plugin-sdk/*` plus local `api.ts` / `runtime-api.ts` barrels as the public surface. Do not import core `src/**`, `src/plugin-sdk-internal/**`, or another extension's `src/**` directly.
- Installers served from `https://openclaw.ai/*`: live in the sibling repo `../openclaw.ai` (`public/install.sh`, `public/install-cli.sh`, `public/install.ps1`).
- Messaging channels: always consider **all** built-in + extension channels when refactoring shared logic (routing, allowlists, pairing, command gating, onboarding, docs).
  - Core channel docs: `docs/channels/`
  - Core channel code: `src/telegram`, `src/discord`, `src/slack`, `src/signal`, `src/imessage`, `src/web` (WhatsApp web), `src/channels`, `src/routing`
  - Extensions (channel plugins): `extensions/*` (e.g. `extensions/msteams`, `extensions/matrix`, `extensions/zalo`, `extensions/zalouser`, `extensions/voice-call`)
- When adding channels/extensions/apps/docs, update `.github/labeler.yml` and create matching GitHub labels (use existing channel/extension label colors).

### Docs Linking (Mintlify)

- Docs are hosted on Mintlify (docs.openclaw.ai).
- Internal doc links in `docs/**/*.md`: root-relative, no `.md`/`.mdx` (example: `[Config](/configuration)`).
- When working with documentation, read the mintlify skill.
- For docs, UI copy, and picker lists, order services/providers alphabetically unless the section is explicitly describing runtime behavior (for example auto-detection or execution order).
- Section cross-references: use anchors on root-relative paths (example: `[Hooks](/configuration#hooks)`).
- Doc headings and anchors: avoid em dashes and apostrophes in headings because they break Mintlify anchor links.
- When Peter asks for links, reply with full `https://docs.openclaw.ai/...` URLs (not root-relative).
- When you touch docs, end the reply with the `https://docs.openclaw.ai/...` URLs you referenced.
- README (GitHub): keep absolute docs URLs (`https://docs.openclaw.ai/...`) so links work on GitHub.
- Docs content must be generic: no personal device names/hostnames/paths; use placeholders like `user@gateway-host` and "gateway host".

### Docs i18n (zh-CN)

- `docs/zh-CN/**` is generated; do not edit unless the user explicitly asks.
- Pipeline: update English docs → adjust glossary (`docs/.i18n/glossary.zh-CN.json`) → run `scripts/docs-i18n` → apply targeted fixes only if instructed.
- Before rerunning `scripts/docs-i18n`, add glossary entries for any new technical terms, page titles, or short nav labels that must stay in English or use a fixed translation (for example `Doctor` or `Polls`).
- `pnpm docs:check-i18n-glossary` enforces glossary coverage for changed English doc titles and short internal doc labels before translation reruns.
- Translation memory: `docs/.i18n/zh-CN.tm.jsonl` (generated).
- See `docs/.i18n/README.md`.
- The pipeline can be slow/inefficient; if it's dragging, ping @jospalmbier on Discord instead of hacking around it.

### exe.dev VM ops (general)

- Access: stable path is `ssh exe.dev` then `ssh vm-name` (assume SSH key already set).
- SSH flaky: use exe.dev web terminal or Shelley (web agent); keep a tmux session for long ops.
- Update: `sudo npm i -g openclaw@latest` (global install needs root on `/usr/lib/node_modules`).
- Config: use `openclaw config set ...`; ensure `gateway.mode=local` is set.
- Discord: store raw token only (no `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=` prefix).
- Restart: stop old gateway and run:
  `pkill -9 -f openclaw-gateway || true; nohup openclaw gateway run --bind loopback --port 18789 --force > /tmp/openclaw-gateway.log 2>&1 &`
- Verify: `openclaw channels status --probe`, `ss -ltnp | rg 18789`, `tail -n 120 /tmp/openclaw-gateway.log`.

### Build, Test, and Development Commands

- Runtime baseline: Node **22+** (keep Node + Bun paths working).
- Install deps: `pnpm install`
- If deps are missing (for example `node_modules` missing, `vitest not found`, or `command not found`), run the repo's package-manager install command (prefer lockfile/README-defined PM), then rerun the exact requested command once. Apply this to test/build/lint/typecheck/dev commands; if retry still fails, report the command and first actionable error.
- Pre-commit hooks: `prek install` (runs same checks as CI)
- Also supported: `bun install` (keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` + Bun patching in sync when touching deps/patches).
- Prefer Bun for TypeScript execution (scripts, dev, tests): `bun <file.ts>` / `bunx <tool>`.
- Run CLI in dev: `pnpm openclaw ...` (bun) or `pnpm dev`.
- Node remains supported for running built output (`dist/*`) and production installs.
- Mac packaging (dev): `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` defaults to current arch.
- Type-check/build: `pnpm build`
- TypeScript checks: `pnpm tsgo`
- Lint/format: `pnpm check`
- Format check: `pnpm format` (oxfmt --check)
- Format fix: `pnpm format:fix` (oxfmt --write)
- Tests: `pnpm test` (vitest); coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`
- Generated baseline artifacts live together under `docs/.generated/`.
- Config schema drift uses `pnpm config:docs:gen` / `pnpm config:docs:check`.
- Plugin SDK API drift uses `pnpm plugin-sdk:api:gen` / `pnpm plugin-sdk:api:check`.
- If you change config schema/help or the public Plugin SDK surface, update the matching baseline artifact and keep the two drift-check flows adjacent in scripts/workflows/docs guidance rather than inventing a third pattern.
- For narrowly scoped changes, prefer narrowly scoped tests that directly validate the touched behavior. If no meaningful scoped test exists, say so explicitly and use the next most direct validation available.
- Preferred landing bar for pushes to `main`: `pnpm check` and `pnpm test`, with a green result when feasible.
- Scoped tests prove the change itself. `pnpm test` remains the default `main` landing bar; scoped tests do not replace full-suite gates by default.
- Hard gate: if the change can affect build output, packaging, lazy-loading/module boundaries, or published surfaces, `pnpm build` MUST be run and MUST pass before pushing `main`.
- Default rule: do not commit or push with failing format, lint, type, build, or required test checks when those failures are caused by the change or plausibly related to the touched surface.
- For narrowly scoped changes, if unrelated failures already exist on latest `origin/main`, state that clearly, report the scoped tests you ran, and ask before broadening scope into unrelated fixes or landing despite those failures.
- Do not use scoped tests as permission to ignore plausibly related failures.

### Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: TypeScript (ESM). Prefer strict typing; avoid `any`.
- Formatting/linting via Oxlint and Oxfmt.
- Never add `@ts-nocheck` and do not disable `no-explicit-any`; fix root causes and update Oxlint/Oxfmt config only when required.
- Dynamic import guardrail: do not mix `await import("x")` and static `import ... from "x"` for the same module in production code paths. If you need lazy loading, create a dedicated `*.runtime.ts` boundary (that re-exports from `x`) and dynamically import that boundary from lazy callers only.
- Dynamic import verification: after refactors that touch lazy-loading/module boundaries, run `pnpm build` and check for `[INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT]` warnings before submitting.
- Extension SDK self-import guardrail: inside an extension package, do not import that same extension via `openclaw/plugin-sdk/<extension>` from production files. Route internal imports through a local barrel such as `./api.ts` or `./runtime-api.ts`, and keep the `plugin-sdk/<extension>` path as the external contract only.
- Extension package boundary guardrail: inside `extensions/<id>/**`, do not use relative imports/exports that resolve outside that same `extensions/<id>` package root. If shared code belongs in the plugin SDK, import `openclaw/plugin-sdk/<subpath>` instead of reaching into `src/plugin-sdk/**` or other repo paths via `../`.
- Extension API surface rule: `openclaw/plugin-sdk/<subpath>` is the only public cross-package contract for extension-facing SDK code. If an extension needs a new seam, add a public subpath first; do not reach into `src/plugin-sdk/**` by relative path.
- Never share class behavior via prototype mutation (`applyPrototypeMixins`, `Object.defineProperty` on `.prototype`, or exporting `Class.prototype` for merges). Use explicit inheritance/composition (`A extends B extends C`) or helper composition so TypeScript can typecheck.
- If this pattern is needed, stop and get explicit approval before shipping; default behavior is to split/refactor into an explicit class hierarchy and keep members strongly typed.
- In tests, prefer per-instance stubs over prototype mutation (`SomeClass.prototype.method = ...`) unless a test explicitly documents why prototype-level patching is required.
- Add brief code comments for tricky or non-obvious logic.
- Keep files concise; extract helpers instead of "V2" copies. Use existing patterns for CLI options and dependency injection via `createDefaultDeps`.
- Aim to keep files under ~700 LOC; guideline only (not a hard guardrail). Split/refactor when it improves clarity or testability.
- Naming: use **OpenClaw** for product/app/docs headings; use `openclaw` for CLI command, package/binary, paths, and config keys.
- Written English: use American spelling and grammar in code, comments, docs, and UI strings (e.g. "color" not "colour", "behavior" not "behaviour", "analyze" not "analyse").

### Release / Advisory Workflows

- Use `$openclaw-release-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/openclaw-release-maintainer/SKILL.md` for release naming, version coordination, release auth, and changelog-backed release-note workflows.
- Use `$openclaw-ghsa-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/openclaw-ghsa-maintainer/SKILL.md` for GHSA advisory inspection, patch/publish flow, private-fork checks, and GHSA API validation.
- Release and publish remain explicit-approval actions even when using the skill.

### Testing Guidelines

- Framework: Vitest with V8 coverage thresholds (70% lines/branches/functions/statements).
- Naming: match source names with `*.test.ts`; e2e in `*.e2e.test.ts`.
- Run `pnpm test` (or `pnpm test:coverage`) before pushing when you touch logic.
- Agents MUST NOT modify baseline, inventory, ignore, snapshot, or expected-failure files to silence failing checks without explicit approval in this chat.
- For targeted/local debugging, keep using the wrapper: `pnpm test -- <path-or-filter> [vitest args...]` (for example `pnpm test -- src/commands/onboard-search.test.ts -t "shows registered plugin providers"`); do not default to raw `pnpm vitest run ...` because it bypasses wrapper config/profile/pool routing.
- Do not set test workers above 16; tried already.
- Do not switch CI `pnpm test` lanes back to Vitest `vmForks` by default without fresh green evidence on current `main`; keep CI on `forks` unless explicitly re-validated.
- If local Vitest runs cause memory pressure (common on non-Mac-Studio hosts), use `OPENCLAW_TEST_PROFILE=low OPENCLAW_TEST_SERIAL_GATEWAY=1 pnpm test` for land/gate runs.
- Live tests (real keys): `CLAWDBOT_LIVE_TEST=1 pnpm test:live` (OpenClaw-only) or `LIVE=1 pnpm test:live` (includes provider live tests). Docker: `pnpm test:docker:live-models`, `pnpm test:docker:live-gateway`. Onboarding Docker E2E: `pnpm test:docker:onboard`.
- Full kit + what's covered: `docs/help/testing.md`.
- Changelog: user-facing changes only; no internal/meta notes (version alignment, appcast reminders, release process).
- Changelog placement: in the active version block, append new entries to the end of the target section (`### Changes` or `### Fixes`); do not insert new entries at the top of a section.
- Changelog attribution: use at most one contributor mention per line; prefer `Thanks @author` and do not also add `by @author` on the same entry.
- Pure test additions/fixes generally do **not** need a changelog entry unless they alter user-facing behavior or the user asks for one.
- Mobile: before using a simulator, check for connected real devices (iOS + Android) and prefer them when available.

### Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Use `$openclaw-pr-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/openclaw-pr-maintainer/SKILL.md` for maintainer PR triage, review, close, search, and landing workflows.
- This includes auto-close labels, bug-fix evidence gates, GitHub comment/search footguns, and maintainer PR decision flow.
- For the repo's end-to-end maintainer PR workflow, use `$openclaw-pr-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/openclaw-pr-maintainer/SKILL.md`.

- `/landpr` lives in the global Codex prompts (`~/.codex/prompts/landpr.md`); when landing or merging any PR, always follow that `/landpr` process.
- Create commits with `scripts/committer "<msg>" <file...>`; avoid manual `git add`/`git commit` so staging stays scoped.
- Follow concise, action-oriented commit messages (e.g., `CLI: add verbose flag to send`).
- Group related changes; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- PR submission template (canonical): `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Issue submission templates (canonical): `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

### Git Notes

- If `git branch -d/-D <branch>` is policy-blocked, delete the local ref directly: `git update-ref -d refs/heads/<branch>`.
- Agents MUST NOT create or push merge commits on `main`. If `main` has advanced, rebase local commits onto the latest `origin/main` before pushing.
- Bulk PR close/reopen safety: if a close action would affect more than 5 PRs, first ask for explicit user confirmation with the exact PR count and target scope/query.

### Local Runtime — Development Standards

- If you need local-only `.agents` ignores, use `.git/info/exclude` instead of repo `.gitignore`.
- When adding a new `AGENTS.md` anywhere in the repo, also add a `CLAUDE.md` symlink pointing to it (example: `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`).
- Signal: "update fly" => `fly ssh console -a flawd-bot -C "bash -lc 'cd /data/clawd/openclaw && git pull --rebase origin main'"` then `fly machines restart e825232f34d058 -a flawd-bot`.
- CLI progress: use `src/cli/progress.ts` (`osc-progress` + `@clack/prompts` spinner); don't hand-roll spinners/bars.
- Status output: keep tables + ANSI-safe wrapping (`src/terminal/table.ts`); `status --all` = read-only/pasteable, `status --deep` = probes.
- SwiftUI state management (iOS/macOS): prefer the `Observation` framework (`@Observable`, `@Bindable`) over `ObservableObject`/`@StateObject`; don't introduce new `ObservableObject` unless required for compatibility, and migrate existing usages when touching related code.
- Connection providers: when adding a new connection, update every UI surface and docs (macOS app, web UI, mobile if applicable, onboarding/overview docs) and add matching status + configuration forms so provider lists and settings stay in sync.
- Version locations: `package.json` (CLI), `apps/android/app/build.gradle.kts` (versionName/versionCode), `apps/ios/Sources/Info.plist` + `apps/ios/Tests/Info.plist` (CFBundleShortVersionString/CFBundleVersion), `apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/Info.plist` (CFBundleShortVersionString/CFBundleVersion), `docs/install/updating.md` (pinned npm version), and Peekaboo Xcode projects/Info.plists (MARKETING_VERSION/CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).
- "Bump version everywhere" means all version locations above **except** `appcast.xml` (only touch appcast when cutting a new macOS Sparkle release).
- **Restart apps:** "restart iOS/Android apps" means rebuild (recompile/install) and relaunch, not just kill/launch.
- **Device checks:** before testing, verify connected real devices (iOS/Android) before reaching for simulators/emulators.
- iOS Team ID lookup: `security find-identity -p codesigning -v` → use Apple Development (…) TEAMID. Fallback: `defaults read com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEProvisioningTeamIdentifiers`.
- A2UI bundle hash: `src/canvas-host/a2ui/.bundle.hash` is auto-generated; ignore unexpected changes, and only regenerate via `pnpm canvas:a2ui:bundle` (or `scripts/bundle-a2ui.sh`) when needed. Commit the hash as a separate commit.
- Release signing/notary credentials are managed outside the repo; maintainers keep that setup in the private [maintainer release docs](https://github.com/openclaw/maintainers/tree/main/release).
- Lobster palette: use the shared CLI palette in `src/terminal/palette.ts` (no hardcoded colors); apply palette to onboarding/config prompts and other TTY UI output as needed.

### Collaboration / Safety Notes

- When working on a GitHub Issue or PR, print the full URL at the end of the task.
- When answering questions, respond with high-confidence answers only: verify in code; do not guess.
- Never update the Carbon dependency.
- Any dependency with `pnpm.patchedDependencies` must use an exact version (no `^`/`~`).
- Patching dependencies (pnpm patches, overrides, or vendored changes) requires explicit approval; do not do this by default.
- **Multi-agent safety:** do **not** create/apply/drop `git stash` entries unless explicitly requested (this includes `git pull --rebase --autostash`). Assume other agents may be working; keep unrelated WIP untouched and avoid cross-cutting state changes.
- **Multi-agent safety:** when the user says "push", you may `git pull --rebase` to integrate latest changes (never discard other agents' work). When the user says "commit", scope to your changes only. When the user says "commit all", commit everything in grouped chunks.
- **Multi-agent safety:** do **not** create/remove/modify `git worktree` checkouts (or edit `.worktrees/*`) unless explicitly requested.
- **Multi-agent safety:** do **not** switch branches / check out a different branch unless explicitly requested.
- **Multi-agent safety:** running multiple agents is OK as long as each agent has its own session.
- **Multi-agent safety:** when you see unrecognized files, keep going; focus on your changes and commit only those.
- Lint/format churn:
  - If staged+unstaged diffs are formatting-only, auto-resolve without asking.
  - If commit/push already requested, auto-stage and include formatting-only follow-ups in the same commit (or a tiny follow-up commit if needed), no extra confirmation.
  - Only ask when changes are semantic (logic/data/behavior).
- **Multi-agent safety:** focus reports on your edits; avoid guard-rail disclaimers unless truly blocked; when multiple agents touch the same file, continue if safe; end with a brief "other files present" note only if relevant.
- Bug investigations: read source code of relevant npm dependencies and all related local code before concluding; aim for high-confidence root cause.
- Code style: add brief comments for tricky logic; keep files under ~500 LOC when feasible (split/refactor as needed).
- Tool schema guardrails (google-antigravity): avoid `Type.Union` in tool input schemas; no `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`. Use `stringEnum`/`optionalStringEnum` (Type.Unsafe enum) for string lists, and `Type.Optional(...)` instead of `... | null`. Keep top-level tool schema as `type: "object"` with `properties`.
- Tool schema guardrails: avoid raw `format` property names in tool schemas; some validators treat `format` as a reserved keyword and reject the schema.
- Never send streaming/partial replies to external messaging surfaces (WhatsApp, Telegram); only final replies should be delivered there. Streaming/tool events may still go to internal UIs/control channel.
- For manual `openclaw message send` messages that include `!`, use the heredoc pattern noted below to avoid the Bash tool's escaping.
- Release guardrails: do not change version numbers without operator's explicit consent; always ask permission before running any npm publish/release step.
- Beta release guardrail: when using a beta Git tag (for example `vYYYY.M.D-beta.N`), publish npm with a matching beta version suffix (for example `YYYY.M.D-beta.N`) rather than a plain version on `--tag beta`; otherwise the plain version name gets consumed/blocked.
